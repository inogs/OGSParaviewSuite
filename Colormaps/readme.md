## Colormaps

These are a collection of colormaps that can be easily installed into ParaView. The current available maps are:

* _hcl_purple2blue_: A purple to blue colormap that attempts to take into account people with color perception deficiencies.
* _OkuboWeiss_: A three color map that goes from 0 to 2 to be applied to the Okubo-Weiss (or Q-criterion) mask to differenciate the strain dominated and the vorticity dominated fields from the background field (green). Opacity is set so that the background field can become transparent.

Guide to install colormaps:

Click on the _Choose Preset_ button (blue) to open the dialog and then click on _Import_ (red). Select the colormap stored and your computer and open it. It should now be visible in the presets list. If not, you might need to toggle the _Advanced_ button (yellow).
