## OGS Compare Variables

The **OGS Compare Variables** lets the user generate a field to visually compare variables. The field (called _comparison_ by default) takes a user determined value if the variable in comparison is greater or smaller than the others. Hence, the regions where one variable predominates over the others can be visualized using specific color maps and annotations.

The pseudocode to select which variables to compare is as follows:

```python
var1 = value1
var2 = value2
...
var_n = value_n
```
and must be inputted in the filter's dialog box.
