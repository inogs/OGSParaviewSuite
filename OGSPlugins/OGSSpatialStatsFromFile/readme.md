## OGS Spatial Stats from File

The **OGS Spatial Stats from File** loads the data from the _STAT_PROFILES_ generated by _avescan_ into ParaView. Some restrictions apply to this filter:

* Due to the nature of the algorithm itself and the data generated by _avescan_ (from _bit.sea_), this code **must** have a _vtkRectilinearGrid_ and must output a _vtkRectilinearGrid_.
* For a correct time exploration, a _STAT_PROFILE_ for each timestep **must** be generated.
* The files must contain all the averages as outputed by _avescan_ in the form **var(sub,coast,z,stat)**.
* The file name must be like **ave.<date>.stat_profiles.nc**.

There are a total of nine statistics considered:

* Mean
* Standard deviation (std)
* Minimum (min)
* Maximum (max)
* Percentile 5% (p05)
* Percentile 25% (p25)
* Percentile 50% (p50)
* Percentile 75% (p75)
* Percentile 95% (p95)

The results od these nine statistics will override whatever variables loaded on the mesh. A warning is raised if the variable is not found and the statistics cannot be loaded. This warning does not stop ParaView from executing.
