## OGS Utilities

The **OGS Utils** filter is a collection of tools specifically designed to enhance the user experience of the **OGS ParaView Suite**. At the moment, they come as extended sources for the **OGS Depth Profile**, **OGS Hovmoeller** and **OGS Spaghetti** filers.

* A modified fixed point source with hidden radius and number of points.
* **OGS Point source** with separate longitude/latitude input as well as depth.
* **OGS Depth Line source** with only vertical component and longitude/latitude input as well as desired depths.

For backwards compatibility, the original ParaView sources have been kept as an optional input method, however, the defaults have been changed to these on the **OGS Utils**.
